A* Search Algorithm

Implementation of the A* search algorithm from psuedocode, created in Unity (C#) using Queue data structure.

- Press "Start" button to select Start position, and "Goal" for destination, once done, press "Search" to perform A* search.
- By default the heuristic function is Manhattan distance, but Euclidean distance can also be selected from the drop down.
- Also, the default grid cell size is 1m square, it can be increased and decreased by inputting a value in the input field.
- Press/hold the right mouse click for obstacles.

The video below demonstrates the usage:
